This was an Idea that I had for a while but had no experience with creating mods at all. However, I was very determined to figure it all out, so enjoy what I poured my hard work into!<br />The main file for this mod includes UI, the crown shown in the preview images on Mr. Game & Watch's base model, as well as new projectiles for his neutral B. I'm pretty satisfied with the mod at the moment but down the line I might add some SFX and a new \"Annihilate\" final smash model.<br />I also included an alternate version of this mod that has spikes on his head that is reminiscent of the ones seen on the Boss in JSAB.

She is the only character in the Nintendo 64 Mario Party games to not have her own board.<br /><br />Daisy's most notable Mario Party appearance is in Mario Party 3. After the player is prompted to earn the Beauty Star Stamp, Daisy intervenes and claims to be worthy of it. She coaxes the Millennium Star into agreeing to hand her the Star Stamp by making him swoon over her, but is stopped by the outraged player. The Millennium Star then decides to settle the issue on the Backtrack Duel Board. Bowser interrupts their departure to this duel board, but is smacked by Daisy and sent flying into the distance. Daisy attempts to justify this by saying he was in her way. The group heads off to the duel board afterward. When the player defeats Daisy, she bursts into tears and flees in frustration. In the game, Daisy's default duel board partner is a Snifit.<br /><br />","category":"Fighter"}],"workspace":"Default"}
